## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security issues very seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in our project, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue, as this may expose the vulnerability to others.
2. Instead, send an email to security@circleci.com with a detailed description of the vulnerability. Include steps to reproduce the issue, if possible.
3. We will respond to your report as soon as possible, acknowledging receipt of the vulnerability and providing an estimated timeline for a fix.
4. We will keep you updated on the progress of addressing the vulnerability.

We appreciate your help in keeping our project secure.
