  help: ## Display this help screen
          @grep -h -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[36m%-30s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'

This snippet handles the `make help` command, and uses the comments from other targets to provide the user with a description of the target. You only need to add a comment (prefixed with `##`) for each target, and the snippet will display the comment it nicely.

For example, here is a Makefile:

```make
blah: ## Builds blah from blah.c file
  cc blah.c -o blah

help: ## Display this help screen
  @grep -h -E '^[a-zA-Z_-]+:.*?## .*$$' $(MAKEFILE_LIST) | sort | awk 'BEGIN {FS = ":.*?## "}; {printf "\033[36m%-30s\033[0m %s\n", $$1, $$2}'
```

And the output:

```sh
$ make help
blah                           Builds blah from blah.c file
help                           Display this help screen
```
