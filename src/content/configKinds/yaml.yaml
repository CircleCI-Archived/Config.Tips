  YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Languageâ„¢) is one of the most commonly used configuration file formats used by developers. 
  It mimics JSON in data structure but is more readable and easier to write and understand. YAML files use the .yaml or .yml extension, and is composed of colon-separated key-value pairs. The data types supported by YAML include numbers, booleans, strings, lists, and dictionaries.
snippet:
  lang: yaml
  filePath: "config.yml"

    # This is a comment
    key: value
    another_key: another_value
    a_list:
      - item1
      - item2
      - item3
    a_dictionary:
      key: value
      another_key: another_value
    a_number: 123
    a_boolean: true
    a_string: "Hello World"
