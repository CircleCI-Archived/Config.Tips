  `package.json` is a manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project's name, author, etc.) and a list of dependencies (other packages that the project depends on).
  It is usually located at the root of a project, and you can tell which package manager is being used by the accompanying 'lock' file. For example, `package-lock.json` is used by npm, `yarn.lock` is used by Yarn, and `pnpm-lock.yaml` is used by pnpm.
  Check the `package.json` file for `scripts` to see what commands are available to run, example: `npm run dev`.
