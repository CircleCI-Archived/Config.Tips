  Vite (pronounced `/vit/`, like "veet") is a JavaScript front-end build tool, created by Evan You, the same person who created [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
  Vite is an increasingly popular choice of build tool and common alternative to older tools like Webpack and Parcel.
  Vite utlizes [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en/) under the hood for fast and efficient bundling, while offering additional modern features like hot module replacement (HMR), built-in TypeScript support, a plugin system, and more.
