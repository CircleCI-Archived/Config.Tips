  `Cargo.toml` is a manifest file for Rust projects, which includes things like metadata (project name, author, license, etc.), a list of targets (i.e. binaries, libraries, etc.), and dependencies for the project.
  In a standard Rust project, a Cargo.toml is in the root of the project and a sibling to the `src/` directory. Using Cargo, it generates a `Cargo.lock` file that can ensure predictable and reproducible dependency resolution between copies of the project.
