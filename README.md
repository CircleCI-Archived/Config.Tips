[Config.Tips](https://config.tips/) is an Open-Source repository of hacks, tips, and tricks, for your favorite development configs, like [.gitconfig](), [nextjs.config.js](https://config.tips/c/nextjs/), and [many more](https://config.tips/c/) .

Join the community and snag or share!

As developers, we each spend endless time configuring our tools and environments. Between the millions of developers in the world, we've all picked up a thing or two, and have creative solutions to share. So we built this site to share our tips with the world, collectively, via open-source.
